            Hi, I'm William, I'm 21 years old, I'm studying Web Design and BYU-Idaho.<br>I'm currently a Sophomore, this is my third semester, but only my second in person.<br>I love performing: acting, singing, etc.<br>I also just love stories, in any form, they have an ability to move and inspire like nothing else. That ability is present in music, theater, books, movies, television, even video games, if a story can move and inspire someone, it has meaning and I think that's beautiful.<br>Also I love my comfort characters, and I am not shy about it.<br>I love people and getting to know people, I just really care about relationships and having people in my life, and helping them when they need it.

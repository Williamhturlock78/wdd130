    Welcome to our quote site! The site is designed for students in the Rexburg, Idaho area to share funny or inspiring things with their fellow students.
Here you can read quotes other people have submitted, submit some quotes of your own or check out the ever changing selection of quotes of the day!


Frequently Asked Questions:


What is the point of this site?


It's for my web design class, it really serves no functional purpose, I've just collected a lot of quotes and thought this sounded fun.


Who can submit a quote?


Anyone! Everyone! You! Please do it! Here's the link again:


Are quotes screened before being submitted?


yes, but just to check to make sure they match the site's guidelines


Do you have to be a BYU-Idaho student?

Why else would you want your quotes posted here? So random people you're never gonna meet can read them? The idea is for the site to have a sense of community built around the users being students at the same campus. You can totally submit if you aren't a student, I'm just not sure what the point would be. You do you though!


About the creator:

I'm a Web Design and Development major. I love people, and I think collecting funny things your friends say is a great way to get closer with them. I'm also really inspired by the people in my life, and feel that they often say things that really help me through the trials I am experiencing.
